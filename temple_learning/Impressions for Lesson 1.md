	A great deal of my temple knowledge really comes from reading two books; The Holy Temple (Boyd K. Packer), and House of the Lord (James E. Talmage). I have gained additional knowledge through more common resources and little readings from, Jesus the Christ (James E. Talmage). 

	This first lesson idea accordingly leans much upon Packer's book.

## First, the centrality and purpose of the temple

### It is ==*Jesus the Christ!*==

> [!THE CENTRALITY OF THE TEMPLE]
> "Central to the message about the temple is that Jesus is the Christ, Son of God, the Only Begotten of the Father; that He lives; that He directs His servants upon this earth. It is His priesthood which has been restored, defined as the Holy Priesthood after the Order of the Son of God (D&C 107:2-4)"

## The Plan of Salvation
In the premortal existence[^1], Father organized a council in heaven. Inherent that "there must needs be an opposition in all things"[^2], there was a war in heaven. Two-thirds of the spirits fought with Michael, the archangel, in following Heavenly Father's plan of salvation. The last third fought with Lucifer, who rebelled against Heavenly Father's plan and "sought to destroy the agency of man". Satan was cast out and was denied the blessings and gifts of Heavenly Father's great plan.
Then was the great Plan initiated. Adam and Eve were chosen to be the first of the children to come to earth. Their transgression brought forth the fall, mortality, and the first spiritual death.[^3] There became a need for a savior. There became a need for a perfect, just, and infinite atonement.[^4] 
A great plan - even a perfect plan - set forth, according to the agency of man, that all mankind may be saved, redeemed, justified, and exalted according to their faithfulness and obedience.

**And  is where temples come in.**

## The Purpose of the Temple
I was taught 3 purposes for the temple that have stayed in my mind:
- To receive your salvation and exaltation through the sacred ordinances and covenants held therein
- To learn and grow - to ultimately become more like - even just like - the Father, and to receive the fullness of His Kingdom
- To complete work for the dead, who have missed the opportunity to receive these covenants and ordinances on their own.

> John 5:25 - "Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live. "

Temples are so essential, and beautiful, because ==the fullness of the saving power of the atonement, through the power of the Holy Priesthood, are accessible ***solely and only*** through the sacred ordinances performed in the temple!==


## Come to the Temple
I have wondered before why I received such strong impression to go through the temple early. Most were surprised by my early initiative, especially when it wasn't in direct preparation for a mission. A complete answer to such question is still not yet clear, but it is clear that without the power and glory of the Temple and the blessings I have received from the sacred ordinances, ceremonies, and covenants therein, I would not stand as I stand today.[^5]

Many faithful saints around the world sacrifice all they have, taking immense amounts of time, to come to the temple. They understand the value and the beauty of His Holy House. 

The temple is beautiful. The temple is powerful. The temple is sacred. The temple is eternal.

	"Our need to be in the temple on a regular basis has never been greater. I plead with you to take a prayerful look at how you spend your time. Invest time in your future and in that of your family. If you have reasonable access to a temple, I urge you to find a way to make an appointment regularly with the Lord--to be in His holy house--then keep that appointment with exactness and joy. I promise you that the Lord will bring the miracles He knows you need as you make sacrifices to serve and worship in his temples."
