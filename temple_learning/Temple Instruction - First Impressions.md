## The Calling:
I don't yet know who I'll be working with for this future calling. The rearrangements will take place probably next Sunday, the 11th. I wonder how it will be working with whoever is my partner in calling. But I am beyond excited for it. It seems an answer to all of what has been happening to me so far. I write about this in detail in longhand.

## What shall we teach in the Holy Temple?
What is important? What should be taught? What is appropriate to be taught?
Below is the lesson plan of the Gospel Library's Temple Preparation Seminar.

	(navigate by Library/Temple and Family History/Temple Preparation/Endowed from on High: Temple Preparation Seminar)

- Lesson 1: The Temple Teaches about the Great Plan of Salvation
- Lesson 2: We Must Be Worthy to Enter the Temple
- Lesson 3: Temple Work Brings Great Blessings into Our Lives
- Lesson 4: Receiving Temple Ordinances and Covenants
- Lesson 5: Learning from the Lord through Symbols
- Lesson 6: Preparing to Enter the Holy Temple
- Lesson 7: Continuing to Enjoy the Blessings of Temple Attendance

In the past, Mara has been disappointed with the content that is housed within these lessons. The titles of each lesson seems to create a fairly comprehensive seminar series, but I can see where some missing, precious things could be added in.

## Below are my impressions for each lesson
*NOTE: these are only impressions. I would not yet consider them lesson plans as I, at the moment, do not have proper authority, neither have I collaborated with the better half of this calling.*
